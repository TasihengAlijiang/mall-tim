1. Project initialization &   Tech Stack
  1.1 Core dependencies
	. Framework: React 19+ (functional components , hooks)
	. Build Tool: Vite(faster development) or Create React App(simple setup)
	. Language: TypeScript (preferred for type safety) or JavaScript(with JSDoc)
	. Routing: React Router v6
	. Sate Management
		. Local state: useState, useReducer
		. Global state: Redux toolkit(comlex apps) or Context API + useReducer(simple apps)
	. UI Library: Ant Design, Material UI, or Tailwind CSS(with a shared design system)
	. HTTP Client: Axios (with request/reponse interceptors)
	. Code Quality: ESLint + Prettier
	. Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
	
  1.2 Project Setup Checklist
	1. initialize the project
	2. Configure ESlint  & Prettier
	3. Set up Git workflow:
	4. Create base folder structure

2. Coding Standards
  2.1 Component Design
	. Use functional components with Hooks (avoid class components)
	. Split components by responsibility
		. Container components (handle logic , data fetching)
		. Presentation components (UI only, receive props)
	. Component naming: PascalCase (ProductDetail.jsx) with filenames matching component names
	. Props: Use Typescript interfaces or PropTypes for validation

  2.2 State Management
        . Local state: Use useState for component-specific state (form inputs)
	. Global state: Centralize with Redux Toolkit for shared state(user ,cart, app settings)
	. 

  2.3 Styling
	. Consistent approach: Use CSS-in-JS (styled-componets), CSS Modues , or Tailwind.
	. Naming conventions: BEM (Block_Element--Modifier) for clas names if using plain CSS.
	. Responsiveness: Use media queries or UI library responsive uitilites
	. Avoid global styles

  2.4 Routing
	 .Define routes in a centrailized src/routes.jsx file
	 .Use React.lazy + Suspense for code splitting


3. Workflow  &  Collaboration
  3.1 Git Workflow
	 1. Create a feature branch from develop
	 2. Commit frequently
	  	add commit -m "feat: add user login form"
		add commit -m "fix: resolve cart quality calculation bug"
		add commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
	 3. Push branch to remote and create a Pull Request (PR) to develop
		Link PR to a task/ticket
	 4. Merge after aproval 
  3.2 Code reviews
	1. Review checklist
		 . Code follows project standards (naming, structure)
		 . Type safty/prop validation is implemented.
		 . Tests cover critical functionality.
		 . No unneccessary dependencies or dead code.
	2. Provide constructive feedback: Focus on code, not the developer

  3.3 Testing
	1.Unit tests: Test individual components/hooks (ProductCard.test.tsx).
	2.Integration tests: Test component interactions (adding to cart).
	3. E2E tests (optional ): Use Cypress for critical flows (checkout ,login).
	4.Coverage target: Aim for >= 70% code coverage



4. Performance & OPtimization
   1. Avoid unnecessary re-renders: Use React.memo, useMemo, useCallback.
   2. Optimise lists: Use react-window or react-virtualized for long lists 
   3. Image optimization: Use next/image (if using Next.js) or loading="lazy" for lazy loading.
   4. Bundle size: Monitor with npm run build -- -- report(Vite) or source-map-explore
   5. API efficiency: Implement caching (React Query) and debounce search inputs



5. Deployment & CI/CD
   staging: Deploy develop branch to a staging environment (Vercel , Preview, Netlify Deploy Preview)
   Production: Deploy master branch to Production 
   CI/CD pipeline (Github Actions example)



6. Documentation
   1. Project README: Setup instructions , tech stack, and architecture overview.
   2. Component docs: Use Storybook to document UI components and their props.
   3. API docs: Document backend endpoints in src/services/api-docs.md.
   4. Onboarding guide: Help new members set up the project locally.


7. Conflict Resolution
   1.Pull latest changes from the base branch before submiiting a PR;
      git checkout feature/my-feature
      git merge develop
      then resolve conflicts locally, then push
